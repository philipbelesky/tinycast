# Release

How a build reaches a user. The local development loop is in [development.md](development.md);
the signing identity itself is in [signing.md](signing.md).

## Packaging a DMG locally

```sh
./Scripts/build-dmg.sh            # -> build/Tinycast-<version>.dmg (version from project.yml)
./Scripts/build-dmg.sh 0.5.7      # -> build/Tinycast-0.5.7.dmg
```

It builds a Release `Tinycast.app` and packs it with an `/Applications` symlink. Signing comes from
`project.yml` rather than the script, so a regenerated project keeps it; the script only checks the
identity resolves before spending a build on it. `TINYCAST_SIGN_IDENTITY` overrides which one it looks
for. Official per-channel releases are built by CI, below.

The finished DMG is then copied to `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Resources`, which is
how it reaches the author's other Macs — iCloud sets no `com.apple.quarantine`, so the app opens there
without the `xattr` step a browser download needs. Override the destination with `TINYCAST_DMG_DROP`; a
destination that doesn't exist is skipped rather than failing the build, so CI and a fresh clone are
unaffected.

The DMG carries only the app: with iCloud settings sync enabled (Settings → Backup,
[features/sync.md](features/sync.md)) the configuration — settings, hotkeys, quicklinks, custom
commands, favorites — follows the iCloud account to every Mac that opts in. A Mac still holding an
old `com.tinycast.app` install runs `Scripts/migrate-channel.sh` once to carry its data into the
renamed channel ([FORK.md](../FORK.md) divergence 10).

## Signing & Gatekeeper

CI releases sign with the stable `Tinycast Self-Signed` identity and local builds with whatever
`project.yml` names (see [FORK.md](../FORK.md) divergence 1) — neither is an Apple Developer ID, so
macOS quarantines a directly-downloaded DMG. The Homebrew cask strips that
automatically; direct downloaders run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "…/Tinycast.app"` once. Full
details in [signing.md](signing.md).

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every PR, on a `macos-26` runner with Xcode 26 (the same selection
step as the release workflow). One job, a merge gate; a new push cancels the in-flight run for the
same ref. Two steps, both of which shell out to a script rather than naming rules or harnesses in the
workflow, so neither can drift:

- **the harnesses** — `./Scripts/run-tests.sh`.
- **lint** — `./Scripts/lint.sh`, with `SWIFTLINT_REPORTER=github-actions-logging` so every violation
  is annotated **inline on the PR diff** instead of being buried in the log. It runs under
  `if: always()`, so a failing harness still surfaces the lint annotations in the same run. Warnings
  annotate only; **lint errors fail the job**, exactly as a local run does.

It does **not** run on pushes to `main`. `pull_request` builds the merge result, so re-running after a
merge would re-test content CI has already seen. A direct push to `main` therefore gets no run at all —
use **Actions → CI → Run workflow** if one ever needs checking.

There is **no `xcodebuild` step**: a Debug build costs minutes on every run and the release workflow
builds before it ships anyway, so CI keeps to the checks that finish in about a minute. The
consequence is that a change compiling nowhere still turns the PR green — **build locally before you
open one**. See [testing.md](testing.md#definition-of-done).

## Releasing

`.github/workflows/release.yml` builds and publishes a DMG from GitHub Actions, no local machine
needed. Run it from the **Actions** tab (`Release` → **Run workflow**) and pick:

- **channel** — `beta` or `stable`. Each builds a distinct app (`Tinycast Beta.app` / `Tinycast.app`)
  with its own bundle id, alongside the local `Tinycast Dev.app`. Beta gets an auto-incrementing
  `-beta.N` suffix (`N` = the Actions run number) so re-running never collides; stable ships the
  version as-is.
- **version** — base semver, e.g. `0.2.0`.

It builds on a `macos-26` runner with Xcode 26 and publishes a GitHub Release tagged
`v<full-version>` with a versioned DMG asset (`Tinycast-<full-version>.dmg`), marked prerelease for
beta. On success it also bumps the matching cask in the tap.

### Homebrew tap automation

The release job's final step rewrites the `version` + `sha256` of the channel's cask (`tinycast` or
`tinycast@beta`) in the [`homebrew-tinycast`](https://github.com/abue-ammar/homebrew-tinycast) tap and
pushes. It needs a `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` repo secret — a fine-grained PAT with **Contents: read/write**
on the tap repo. Without the secret the step logs a warning and skips; the release still publishes.

## Website

`.github/workflows/website.yml` builds `website/` (Next.js static export + Tailwind, with Fumadocs for
the docs section) and deploys it to GitHub Pages at `https://abue-ammar.github.io/tinycast/` on every
push to `main` that touches `website/`. Enable it once via
**Settings → Pages → Source = GitHub Actions**.

```sh
cd website && npm install && npm run dev     # local preview
```

The workflow uploads `website/out` — a Next.js export lands there, not in `dist/`. `public/.nojekyll`
must stay: GitHub Pages runs Jekyll, which ignores `_`-prefixed directories, so without it every
asset under `_next/` 404s. See [website/README.md](../website/README.md).

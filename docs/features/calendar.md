# Calendar and meeting join

Four surfaces over the Mac's own calendar: a **join card** at the top of an empty launcher, a
**Join Next Meeting** global shortcut, the **menu bar**, and meetings that **join themselves**.
Around them sit five launcher commands, a `My Schedule` sub-screen, a camera preview, and individual
events as searchable launcher entries.

## Invariants

- **Nothing polls, and there is one timer.** `.EKEventStoreChanged` is the reload signal, held
  through the RAII `NotificationToken`, and `NSWorkspace.didWakeNotification` covers the sleep it
  cannot. `MeetingClock` is the only timer: one tick on the minute boundary, running **while
  something is watching** — the palette, the menu bar, or auto join. With all three off, an idle Mac
  owns no timer at all. `CalendarCoordinator.applyClock` is the one place that decides, and the
  clock's `Task` is stored and cancelled in `stop()` and in an `isolated deinit`.
- **Auto join fires at most once per meeting per launch**, and only for a meeting starting at or
  after the moment the switch was armed. Both are why `AutoJoinPolicy` takes `armedAt` and the
  already-joined set rather than reading a clock of its own.
- **The camera settles before the panel opens, and stops after it closes.**
  `CameraPreviewSession.start()` resolves access and blocks on `startRunning` first, then hands
  `CameraPreviewController` a settled `Feed` — so the panel's first frame is live video rather than a
  stage it has to swap out, and the TCC prompt never takes key from a panel already up.
  `stop()` runs from the fade-out's completion, so the camera light never outlives the preview but
  is never torn down under a visible one either.
- **The card's window is `[start - lead, min(start + lead, end)]`.** The grace period exists because
  everyone joins late; the `min` is why it never outlives a meeting shorter than the lead.
- **Recurrence comes from `predicateForEvents(withStart:end:calendars:)`**, which expands occurrences
  itself. Masters are never fetched and recurrence is never hand-rolled.
- **`UpcomingWindow.agenda` is the only place that says which events count** — timed, not declined,
  not over, in start order. The card, the chord, the menu bar, the schedule and the launcher slice all
  go through it, so they cannot drift apart. Because an event ending changes nothing in EventKit,
  the filter alone is not enough for the launcher slice: `CalendarCoordinator` republishes it on the
  minute boundary and on every summon.
- **`calendarEnabled` doubles as consent**, so it is in `SettingsBackupCoverage.deliberatelyExcluded`
  and only `CalendarCoordinator.setCalendarEnabled` may write it. Tinycast's own dialog comes first,
  the macOS prompt second, and only from the gesture that asked.
- **Per-calendar toggles live on `CalendarStore`, not `AppSettings`.** Calendar identifiers are
  machine-specific, so they are deliberately outside the backup mirror — the same reasoning as
  `palettePosition`.
- **`Model/` stays Foundation-only**; `calendar-test` compiles the shipped sources. EventKit lives in
  `Service/CalendarStore.swift` and nothing EventKit-shaped leaves it.

## The pure layer

`Model/` holds the whole decision, with every clock read injected:

- **`MeetingLink`** — the join link plus its `Provider`. Ten named services, plus `.generic` for any
  other `http(s)` link the event carries.
- **`MeetingEvent`** — one occurrence, flattened out of `EKEvent`.
- **`UpcomingWindow`** — `agenda`, `carded`, `joinable` and `countdown`.
- **`MeetingDay`** — the Today / Tomorrow buckets, mirroring the clipboard's `DateBucket`.
- **`MenuBarSummary`** — which event the menu bar carries, and for how long.
- **`AutoJoinPolicy`** — whether a meeting should open itself, and which one.
- **`EventDraft`** — what the New Event prompt collects, before anything touches the calendar.

### Finding the link

`MeetingLink.detect(fields:)` is handed `[event.url, event.location, event.notes]` in that order and
scans each for `http(s)` runs. **A named provider anywhere beats a bare link found earlier**, so a
"reset your password" URL at the top of an invite never wins over the Meet link below it.

Link extraction is hand-rolled rather than `NSDataDetector`: a detector is not `Sendable`, and
rebuilding one per event costs more than the scan it replaces. A URL ends at whitespace or a quote,
and trailing punctuation is trimmed, so `(https://whereby.com/acme).` yields the URL alone.

**A URL on a known host that fails that provider's path rule is rejected outright, not demoted to
`.generic`** — `zoom.us/download` sits in half the invites people are sent, and `meet.google.com/tel/…`
is a dial-in helper rather than a meeting.

### Opening it

`MeetingLauncher.join` prefers the desktop app: `MeetingLink.appURL` rewrites a Zoom link to
`zoommtg://zoom.us/join?confno=…` (carrying `pwd` when present) and a `teams.microsoft.com` link to
`msteams:` plus its path and query. Nothing else is rewritten — the rest of the table has no
unambiguous scheme, and guessing one would open the wrong thing. If no app claims the scheme, the
plain `https` link opens instead.

No brand artwork ships with the app, so every named provider draws `video.fill` and the **name**
carries the identity; `.generic` draws `link`.

## The card

The card is `LauncherScreen.Row.meeting`, prepended the way the calculator card is. The two can never
both lead: **the calculator only answers a typed query and the card only an empty one**, which is what
keeps the flat selection index a single-row offset. `LauncherList.LeadCard` is that fact made
structural — one optional card, one selected flag, one activate closure, whichever feature owns it.

The countdown re-renders from `MeetingClock.now`, not from a keystroke, so `in 4 min` becomes
`in 3 min` on the boundary. A partial minute rounds **up** (`in 1 min` at 20 seconds out), and the
first minute past the start reads `now` rather than `0 min ago`.

Like the calculator card, a card appearing while the palette is already open shifts the highlight down
by one row. That is the existing behaviour of the row above it and is left alone.

## The chord

`UpcomingWindow.joinable` is deliberately wider than `carded`, and answers in this order:

1. Whatever the card is showing — so the chord always joins what is on screen.
2. Anything currently running, however long ago it started.
3. The next meeting with a link.

It reads the live clock rather than `MeetingClock`, because a chord fires with the palette closed and
nothing ticking.

## Commands

All five leave the launcher when the feature is off, through `CalendarCoordinator.applyEnabled`,
the `applyQuicklinksPresence` twin.

| Command | Does | Bindable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Join Next Meeting | Opens the link for the carded, running, or next meeting. | yes |
| My Schedule | Opens the `.schedule` palette mode. | yes |
| Create Event | Prompts for a title, a start and a duration, and writes the event. | yes |
| Copy Meeting Link | The same meeting's link, to the pasteboard. | no |
| Open in Calendar | Hands the meeting to Calendar.app. | no |

**A command that opens a surface is bindable**; the two that act on the next meeting are reached
through the join card's own ⌘K menu instead, where the meeting they act on is on screen.

A miss reports through the HUD (`Nothing to join right now`), not a dialog: it is transient and there
is nothing to acknowledge.

## Reading the store

`CalendarStore` queries `[startOfToday, endOfTomorrow + 1 day)` in the Mac's own zone. **The fetch
stays on the main actor**: two days of events is a sub-millisecond query and `EKEventStore` is not
`Sendable`, so pushing it off-main would be a fight with no measurable gain. Both the launch-time load
and the per-summon refresh are deferred into a `Task`, because the first EventKit query pays for its
XPC warm-up and both of those paths are protected.

The `EKEventStore` itself is built on first use, so a Mac with the feature off never loads EventKit.
After a grant the store is dropped and rebuilt — one built before the grant does not see the new
calendars.

`MeetingEvent.id` is the event identifier plus the occurrence's start, because a recurring series
shares one identifier across every instance. `calendarItemID` is kept separately: it is the only
handle `ical://ekevent/…` accepts, and a recurring occurrence opens its series.

A cancelled event never reaches a surface. A declined one is dropped by `agenda`, and an all-day or
already-finished one with it.

## The menu bar

`MenuBarSummary` decides what the menu-bar item carries: the earliest event still inside its window,
which is `[start - lead, start)` for **Automatically** and `[start - lead, min(start + hideAfter, end))`
for the timed options. Because the earliest qualifying event wins, one hiding hands the space to the
next with no extra logic.

`MenuBarLabel` reads the coordinator rather than the stores, which is what scopes Observation to the
label instead of re-running the whole `MenuBarExtra` scene. It falls back to the app's own glyph when
nothing is due, so the item never disappears out from under the user, and the title is capped at
`MenuBarSummary.titleCap` characters — a hard cap is the only thing that bounds a menu bar.

A click opens the usual menu, with `Join <title>` added on top. **A bare click never joins**: the
menu bar is not a button, and a mis-click there would open a call.

## Auto join and the preview

`AutoJoinPolicy` answers the meeting the join card is already showing, narrowed by three rules —
`start >= armedAt`, `now >= start`, and not already joined. Reusing `UpcomingWindow.carded` rather
than inventing a second window is what keeps one knob, `joinWindowMinutes`, governing the card, the
chord and auto join alike.

The meeting is marked joined **before** the confirmation is raised, so declining does not re-ask a
minute later.

Every join — the card, the chord, the menu bar, auto join — funnels through
`CalendarCoordinator.join(_:uninvited:)`:

```
join(meeting)
  ├─ no link ────────────► openInCalendar
  ├─ camera preview on ──► CameraPreviewController.present → join, or drop
  ├─ uninvited + confirm ► core.confirm → join, or drop
  └─ otherwise ──────────► MeetingLauncher.join
```

**The preview is itself a confirmation**, so it stands in for one when both are on rather than asking
twice. `CameraPreviewPanel` sits at `.floating`, below a dialog's `.modalPanel`, so a failure report
still lands on top of it.

## Settings

The Calendar pane carries the master switch (routed through the coordinator so the consent gate cannot
be bypassed), the `Join Next Meeting` recorder, the join-window picker, and the per-calendar checkbox
list — `LauncherItemsSection`'s shape, including the one `Form` row holding a `LazyVStack`, because a
`Form` realizes every row it is handed.

The hidden-calendar set stores **exclusions**, so a calendar added after the setting was written
defaults to on. Holidays and Birthdays are what people switch off.

`autoJoinMeetings` and `cameraPreview` join `calendarEnabled` in
`SettingsBackupCoverage.deliberatelyExcluded`: one arms the app to open links unattended and the
other turns on the camera, and an import must grant neither. The menu-bar settings carry over
normally.

Both menu-bar enums put their default at `rawValue == 0`, so `defaults.integer(forKey:)` returning 0
for an unset key lands on `.never` and `.automatically` rather than fighting them.

The Permissions pane shows calendar access alongside Accessibility, but only ever opens System
Settings: the Calendar pane's own switch is the one place that may prompt.

# Inline calculator

`Features/Calculator/Model/` is a **Foundation-only** engine (no AppKit / SwiftUI imports) fronted by
`CalcMemo`, a one-deep memo mirroring `AppIndex`'s. It must stay Foundation-only because the
`Tests/calc-test.swift` harness compiles the real engine sources — including `CalcDateTime`. It is
also **pure**: the inputs it can't compute — the FX rate table and the Mac's own currency — are passed
in (see Currency below).

## Invariants

- **`Model/` (including `CalcDateTime`) stays Foundation-only *and pure*** — no AppKit or SwiftUI, no
  clock read, no network, **no `Locale`**. `calc-test` compiles the real engine sources. Every
  externally-sourced input is injected: the clock via `now`/`calendar`, the FX table via `rates`, and
  the Mac's own currency via `region`, which `RegionCurrency` reads and `CalcMemo` passes down.
- **`CalcEngine.evaluate` never fetches** — it takes a finished `CurrencyRates?`, nil meaning no
  enabled snapshot has landed yet. `CurrencyRateStore` owns the enable flag, fetch and cacheless
  `.ephemeral` session, and `CurrencyFeed` — pure, so the harness covers it — turns the payloads into
  that snapshot.
- **`CurrencyData.generated.swift` is emitted by `node Scripts/gen-currencies.js`** and never hand-edited.
  Three currency tables are hand-maintained, all in `CalcCurrency`: `contested`, the nouns several
  currencies share (`dollars`, `pounds`); `isoNames`, the standard's own names where CLDR substitutes
  a different one (ISO 4217 calls CNY "Yuan Renminbi"); and `crypto`, which no standards body names.
  Do not add slang or synonyms to any of them — no source of truth, so they rot.

## Evaluation pipeline

`CalcEngine.evaluate` runs:

1. Natural-language date/time (`CalcDateTime`, e.g. `hrs till 9am`, `days till 9april`,
   `today + 3 weeks`)
2. Numeric reject
3. Tokenize
4. Complete-prefix evaluation for a trailing binary operator (`10kg +` → `10 kg`)
5. Base conversion
6. Explicit unit conversion (`10km to mi`)
7. **Typed quantity arithmetic** (`10kg + 500g`, `$10 + €5`, `(1hr + 30min) to s`,
   `(20 sgd to usd) * 30`), which also answers a bare amount (`1 usd`, `1 btc`) in the Mac's own
   currency
8. **Currency conversion** (`1 euro to dollars`, `€20 to GBP`, `1 btc to eur`)
9. **Bare-unit auto-conversion** (`1m` → feet + inches, `1hr` → 60 min, via
   `CalcUnits.parseBareConversion` + the `autoTargets` map)
10. Plain arithmetic

Date/time depends on the clock, so it takes an injected `now` / `calendar` — the public `evaluate(_:)`
uses the live clock, and `evaluate(_:now:calendar:)` lets `calc-test.swift` assert exact strings
against a fixed clock.

`CalcDateTime` recognizes four grammars:

- **A** — duration until a moment: `hrs till 9am`, `days till 9april`
- **B** — duration since a past moment: `days since 9jul`, `hrs since noon`
- **C** — a moment ± a duration: `today + 3 weeks`, `now + 90 min`
- **D** — difference between two moments: `jul 4 - today`

A bare, recurring date or time resolves by _bias_: `till` takes the upcoming occurrence, `since` the
most recent past one; an absolute date ignores the bias. Grammar D only engages when at least one
operand contains a letter, because two letter-free operands (`5/2 - 1/2`) are equally valid as
arithmetic and are left to the calculator rather than silently read as dates. Two-digit years expand
the way date pickers do — 00–68 to the 2000s, 69–99 to the 1900s.

`CalcQuantity` is a separate typed precedence parser rather than a mode added to the scalar
`CalcParser`. Scalar `*` / `/` preserve the unit, compatible quantity division returns a scalar, and a
trailing `to` / `in` converts the complete expression. A conversion inside parentheses is itself a
quantity, so `(20 sgd to usd) * 30` converts then multiplies. Percentages keep relative semantics
for addition (`10kg + 20%` → `12 kg`) and act as fractional scalars for multiplication and division
(`10kg * 3%` → `0.3 kg`, `10kg / 25%` → `40 kg`).

**The last unit typed decides the answer's unit.** `+` / `-` convert the _left_ side into the right
operand's unit, so `5feet + 1m` is `2.524 m` and `10kg + 500g` is `10,500 g` — the unit you finished
writing is the one you were thinking in. Chains are left-associative, so `1kg + 500g + 2lb` ends in
pounds. A conversion suffix overrides it entirely (`10kg + 500g to lb`).

Adjacency is the exception. `5 feet 3 inches` and `1hr 30min` are one quantity in composite notation,
not a sum, so they answer in the _leading_ unit (`5.25 ft`, `1.5 hr`). `QuantityParser.peekBinary`
already distinguishes the two — it reports `consumesToken: false` for the invisible `+` between
adjacent quantities — and `addOrSubtract` keys the unit choice off exactly that flag.

A bare number takes the unit it is written against: `5kg+5` is `10 kg`, `$10 + 5` is `15.00 USD`. Under
adjacency the same input stays silent, because there a bare trailing number is a unit still being
typed — `1hr 30` is one keystroke short of `1hr 30min`, and answering `31 hr` would be worse than
answering nothing.

Once an operator is involved the answer stays in the units written, so `2 * 5kg` is `10 kg`. Only a
bare quantity (`50cm`, `1m`) falls through to the keyword-less auto-conversion below.

Derived dimensions are deliberately not guessed: multiplying two unit values returns a clear error.
Affine temperatures may only be added or subtracted when both operands use the same scale; treating
an absolute Celsius/Fahrenheit value as a delta would silently produce physically incorrect answers.

Errors are reserved for input that can only be a mistake — two incompatible units (`1kg + 1m`), or a
unit against a currency. Everything else that cannot be evaluated stays silent rather than flashing a
card mid-keystroke.

An attached `k` is a thousands suffix (`10k` → `10,000`), while whitespace keeps Kelvin explicit
(`10 k to c`); the established attached Kelvin conversion form remains valid when the temperature
target makes the intent unambiguous (`273.15K to C`).

Scientific notation (`1e5` → `100,000`, `5e-3km`, `3e+2`) is read only while the exponent hugs the
mantissa, which is what keeps `2 e` and `2e` reading as 2 × Euler's _e_ — an exponent needs digits
after the `e`. Like `10k`, it tokenizes as a shorthand rather than a plain literal, so a lone `1e5`
still earns a card where a lone `100000` deliberately doesn't. A literal that overflows to infinity
(`1e400`) is treated as non-calculator input, not as a card.

## Implicit multiplication

Juxtaposition means `*` at the same binding power as an explicit one (`4(2+3)` → 20, `2pi`,
`2sqrt(9)`, `(2+3)(2+3)`), so it binds tighter than `+` and looser than `^`, and `6/2(1+2)` agrees
with `6/2*(1+2)`. `CalcParser.parseExpression` checks it after `peekBinary()` fails and, unlike a real
operator, consumes no token before parsing the right operand.

The scalar side is deliberately narrow: only `(` or a name in `CalcParser.constants` / `functions`
starts an implicit product. Adjacent _numbers_ never do — `5 3` stays an app search — and no unit or
currency name is a constant or function, so `10km` keeps its own path. `QuantityParser.peekBinary`
carries the same `(` rule so the typed side agrees (`$5(2)` → `10.00 USD`, `2(3)kg` → `6 kg`, matching
`2*(3)kg`); adjacency there still means the composite-quantity `+` described above, never a product.

## Modulo

`mod` is a binary operator at `*` / `/` precedence, computed with `truncatingRemainder` so the sign
follows the dividend (`-10 mod 3` → -1). It is spelled out on purpose: `%` already means percent, and
`20% - 5` offers no local signal to tell a percent from a remainder, so overloading the symbol would
silently rewrite expressions like `450 + 20% - 5`.

A query ending in a binary operator keeps the last complete prefix visible while the next operand is
being typed: `10 +` shows `10`, `10kg + 500g +` shows `10,500 g`, and `$10 +` shows `10.00 USD`
when currency is enabled. The prefix must itself be valid, so malformed input and incomplete
parentheses remain silent. The partial result preserves the complete prefix's target badge, making
the result's unit or currency explicit beneath the value. Only operators qualify — a trailing English
word such as `of` does not, so `10 of` stays a search. When the prefix was a conversion the card
echoes the typed text (`10km to mi ×`) rather than the conversion's own shortened echo, and
`tokenQuery` keeps radix prefixes so `0xff -` still reads Hexadecimal → Decimal.

## Currency

`CalcCurrency` mirrors `CalcUnits`' shape: a lookup table plus a `parseConversion` over the same
`expr from (to|in|->) to` token shape, so `eur to usd` implies an amount of 1 exactly like `m to ft`.
A leading sign is swapped back into amount-first order, so `€20 to GBP` and `20€ to GBP` parse alike.

The table is **generated except for the judgement calls**. `node Scripts/gen-currencies.js` joins three
sources on the ISO code and emits `CurrencyData.generated.swift`:

- **The fiat rate feed** decides which currencies exist — the same feed the rates come from, so the
  table can never list something the app can't price.
- **CLDR's supplemental currency data** decides which of those are still spent. The feed carries no
  retirement metadata and happily quotes codes their countries abandoned years ago, so a code CLDR
  marks live in some region is kept, a code CLDR retired everywhere is dropped, and a code CLDR never
  mentions is also kept — absence of evidence is not retirement, and that distinction is what
  preserves `CNH`, the metals, `XDR` and the Crown Dependencies' pounds, none of which are any
  region's tender. 159 codes survive.
- **CLDR** (`en`) decides what humans call them: display name, currency sign, singular/plural noun.
  Read from the pinned `cldr-json` checkout, not the host's `Intl`, whose output shifts with the
  local ICU version.

Only _unambiguous_ CLDR data is emitted — 26 signs and 130 nouns. CLDR itself supplies the sign
tie-break: it writes every dollar but USD as `CA$`/`A$`/`NT$`, so plain `$` is claimed by exactly one
currency. Bare Latin letters CLDR lists as symbols (`P` for BWP, `L` for HNL) are dropped, since a
letter is indistinguishable from a word to the tokenizer. Accented nouns are emitted both as written
and folded, so `krónur` and `kronur` both resolve. The noun itself is the name's last word, which is
only wrong where that word isn't one — `NOT_NOUNS` in the generator drops those ("Special Drawing
Rights" is not a "rights").

What's left hand-written in `CalcCurrency.swift` starts with `contested`: the nouns several
currencies share, where CLDR correctly refuses to choose and the calculator must. `dollars` is
claimed by 22 currencies, `francs` 10, `pounds` 9, `pesos` 8, `rupees` 6. CLDR says "US dollars" and
"Canadian dollars"; nothing in it says a bare "dollars" is USD. Words that stay genuinely ambiguous
are assigned to nobody — `krona` is both SEK and ISK, so it produces no card. Slang and synonyms
(`quid`, `bucks`) are deliberately _not_ carried: they'd be hand-maintained data with no source of
truth. `isoNames` is the narrow exception that proves the rule: where ISO 4217 itself names a
currency and CLDR substitutes a different word, the standard's name is carried with the standard as
its source — CNY is "Yuan Renminbi" to ISO 4217, so `rmb` and `renminbi` resolve, while CLDR's own
"Chinese Yuan" supplies `yuan` through the generator.

### Crypto

`CalcCurrency.crypto` is the third hand-written table, and the only one with no external source at
all: no standards body names a coin, and the feed silently omits any symbol it can't price, so it
can't even report which exist. The list is therefore a product choice — and it is also the symbol
list the fetch asks for, since `CurrencyRateStore` builds its request from `cryptoCodes`. The two
cannot drift apart. A symbol the feed drops reports `No exchange rate for <CODE>.`, exactly like an
unquoted fiat code, and starts working again on its own if the feed picks it back up.

Coins join the same `byName` table as `CurrencyDef`s, so every existing path — the sign tokenizer,
the `BTC1K` prefix split, `parseConversion`, typed arithmetic — works on them unchanged. They are
inserted **after** the generated nouns, so a ticker outranks one: `1 sol` is Solana while `soles` and
`pen` still reach the Peruvian sol. That is the only word the two tables both claim.

Order is the whole disambiguation story. Currency runs **after** the unit path, so a query both sides
of which are compatible units stays a measurement: `10 pounds to kg` is weight, `10 pounds to euros`
is money, and `1 cup to ml` stays volume even though `CUP` is the Cuban peso. A currency on one side
and a unit on the other produces the same friendly category error as any other mismatch
(`Cannot convert Currency to Weight.`).

The typed quantity path uses the same ordering and injected rate snapshot. Currency arithmetic is
therefore deterministic: `$10 + €5` converts the left operand into euros when rates are available —
the same last-unit-typed rule the measurements follow. Bare prefix and suffix signs (`$10`, `10$`)
are accepted, and a conversion suffix applies to the whole expression. Parentheses make the
conversion an operand (`(20 sgd to usd) * 30`), matching a trailing suffix on a scalar product
(`20 sgd * 30 to usd`).

### The Mac's own currency

An amount with no target answers in the region currency: on a machine set to Bangladesh, `1 usd`
reads `122.84 BDT`, badged `US Dollar → Bangladeshi Taka`, and `1 btc` follows the same rule. The
region comes from `RegionCurrency`, one `Locale.current.currency` read — a preference, so nothing
ever asks for location, and a `Model/` file never performs it.

The target only applies where there is genuinely nothing else to say. An operator keeps the currency
written (`$10 + €5` stays euros), an explicit target overrides everything, a trailing operator holds
the typed currency while the expression is still being written (`$10 +`), and a lone code with no
amount is still an app search. Where the region names no currency, names one the table doesn't carry,
names the currency already written, or names one the snapshot doesn't quote, the amount answers in
the currency written rather than erroring about a code the user never typed.

### Exchange rates

Currency conversion reaches the network and ships **on** ([FORK.md](../../FORK.md) divergence 15):
rates download from the provider once a day from first launch, and the switch in
Settings → Miscellaneous turns it off. There is no consent sheet.

`CurrencyRateStore` re-checks the flag at every entry point rather than trusting a caller: reading the
cache at init, the `source` the engine is handed, `start()`, each turn of the refresh loop, and twice
around the network call itself — once before the request and once after the `await`, since the switch
can be flipped while a response is in flight. Turning it off cancels the loop, drops the snapshot and
deletes the cached file. The flag lives on the store, deliberately _not_ in `AppSettings`, so importing
a backup cannot move network access either way. When off, `source` passes nil to the pure engine and
no request can begin; the same value also represents an enabled store whose first snapshot has not
landed, so a currency query reports rates unavailable in either state.

The fetch runs on a private **cacheless** `URLSession` (`.ephemeral`, `urlCache = nil`) rather than
`URLSession.shared`, so `currency-rates.json` stays the only copy on disk. The feed serves the table
`Cache-Control: public, max-age=…`, so the shared session would keep a second copy in the on-disk
`URLCache` that deleting the snapshot doesn't touch.

Rates come from `CurrencyRateStore` (`Calculator/Service/`, owned by `AppCore`), which issues two
requests concurrently: the fiat table, keyed `<base><code>` with the base's own row omitted, and the
coin table, which quotes the **inverse** — one coin priced in the base. `CurrencyFeed` folds both
into the single units-per-base map `CurrencyRates` stores, inverting the coins on the way in and
merging them last so a symbol both feeds quote takes the coin feed's own price. One flat table means
`convert(_:from:to:)` cross-rates fiat against crypto with no special case anywhere downstream.

The fiat half is required; the coins are best-effort. A run that misses them still answers for the
session but is **not** written to disk, and retries in **30 minutes** rather than waiting out the day.
Both halves of that follow from the store scheduling off the newest _whole_ snapshot rather than off
whatever `rates` currently holds: a partial one answers without resetting the clock, so it can neither
park the loop for a day nor be reloaded at launch as though it were complete.

The same rule absorbs a cached snapshot written before crypto existed. It still prices fiat, so it is
served rather than discarded — but it counts as no age at all, so the store re-fetches immediately
instead of trusting a `fetchedAt` that says the table is hours fresh. `CurrencyFeed.pricesCoins` is
that test, and it is sound only because a partial snapshot is never persisted.

The table is cached at `~/Library/Caches/<bundle-id>/currency-rates.json` and refreshed every 24h.
The feed republishes about once a day, so a tighter interval would cost requests without returning
newer numbers. Age is measured from the persisted `fetchedAt`, not from launch, so relaunching
Tinycast never re-fetches a snapshot that is still fresh — a cold start with a same-day cache makes
zero requests. Offline, the last snapshot keeps answering; with no snapshot at all the card says so
rather than guessing, and a currency the feed doesn't quote reports `No exchange rate for <CODE>.`
The store hands `CalcEngine.evaluate` a finished `CurrencyRates` value — the engine never fetches,
which is what keeps it Foundation-only and testable. `CalcMemo` keys its memo on the snapshot's
`fetchedAt` and the region currency, so either changing re-evaluates without diffing every rate.

Money rounds to two decimals (`CalcFormatter.currency`), widening to four significant digits below a
cent — in _plain_ notation, deliberately not `%g`, so `1 IDR to USD` reads `0.00005539 USD` rather
than `5.539e-05`.

## Result and rendering

`CalcResult` carries an `expression` (left), a `display` / `copyText` payload (right), and optional
`sourceBadge` / `targetBadge` word-name pills. `CalculatorCard` renders it as a two-column card.

When the launcher or Calculator History query evaluates to a result the card is pinned at the top of
the list (flat selection index 0, shifting rows by one) and Enter copies the answer + records it to
`CalculatorHistoryStore`.

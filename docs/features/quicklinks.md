# Quicklinks

A quicklink turns a URL, search, file, folder or deeplink into a first-class command: searchable in
the launcher, bindable to a global shortcut, and openable in a chosen app. Dynamic placeholders let
one quicklink adapt to typed input, the clipboard, the selection, or the date.

The feature ships **on** ([FORK.md](../../FORK.md) divergence 15). **Settings → Quicklinks** carries
the switch and its launcher-visibility companion. Off is fully off: no launcher section, no `Create` / `Search` / `Import` / `Export`
Quicklinks commands, and `QuicklinkCoordinator.openQuicklink` — the single funnel palette activation and global
shortcuts both reach — refuses to open anything. Bindings stay registered, so re-enabling restores
every shortcut without re-registering.

## Invariants

- **Quicklinks are authored data, and their store never deletes.** A database that will not open is
  **reported, never discarded** — `ClipboardStore`'s delete-and-recreate is only sound because history is
  regenerable, and a link library is not. The database lives in **Application Support**, not Caches.
- **`Model/` stays Foundation-only (plus SQLite3) and pure** for `quicklink-test` — the home directory is
  injected, never read. `Service/QuicklinkLauncher` owns every `NSWorkspace` call and
  `Service/QuicklinkArgumentSession` the prompt state.
- **`Quicklink.precedes` is the one display order**, sorted through by both the store and the `AppIndex`
  slice.
- **There is one template engine.** Quicklinks expand through `SnippetTemplateEngine` rather than a
  second parser, which is what makes `| raw` mean something — it opts a value out of the automatic
  percent-encoding a URL destination asks for. `{selectedText}` is accepted as an alias for
  `{selection}`, but nothing ever *writes* it.

## Destinations

`QuicklinkDestination.detect` decides what a link is from its shape alone — no filesystem or Launch
Services read — which is what keeps it pure and covered by `Tests/quicklink-test.swift`. In order:

| Shape                                                  | Result                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `~/…`, `/…`, `file://…`                                | `.path`, tilde expanded against the injected home                 |
| `http:` · `https:`                                     | `.web`                                                            |
| `smb:` · `afp:` · `nfs:` · `ftp:` · `sftp:` · `ftps:`  | `.network`                                                        |
| any other `scheme:`                                    | `.deeplink` (`spotify://`, `slack://`, `shortcuts://`, `mailto:`) |
| a bare host with a letter-led TLD (`github.com/a?b=c`) | `.web`, `https://` prepended                                      |
| anything else                                          | nothing — the link is rejected                                    |

Two false positives are excluded deliberately, because both are commoner than the schemes they would
shadow: a one-letter "scheme" is a Windows drive letter, and a `scheme:` whose remainder is all
digits is a `host:port`. A literal space is rescued by encoding it; anything else illegal is a real
error, since blanket re-encoding would corrupt the `%xx` the template engine already produced.

The detected kind decides the icon a row draws when the quicklink has no icon of its own, and
`usesURLEncoding` decides whether substituted values are percent-encoded. That question is answered
from the link's **prefix**, not from a parsed destination, because the encoding has to be chosen
before the placeholders are resolved.

## Placeholders

Quicklinks reuse Tinycast's one template engine — the same
[`SnippetTemplateEngine`](snippets.md#template-tokens) snippets use, so every token and every modifier
is available and there is no second parser to keep in sync. `{cursor}` and `{snippet:…}` are text
concerns with nothing to resolve against in a destination, so they are left literal.

```text
https://google.com/search?q={argument}
https://github.com/search?q={argument name="Repository"}
https://translate.google.com/?text={selection}
https://chat.openai.com/?q={clipboard}
~/Notes/{date format="yyyy-MM-dd"}.md
```

**Values going into a URL or deeplink are percent-encoded automatically**, so a search term with a
space or an `&` can't truncate the destination. Encoding is applied _after_ the modifier pipeline, so
`| uppercase` can't rewrite the `%xx` hex, and it is skipped when the template already spoke for
itself — `| raw` opts out, `| percent-encode` has done it once already. A local path is never
encoded: `%20` in a path is a literal, not a space.

`| raw` opts out of more than the escaping. Whether a link is a website, a path or a deeplink is
decided by `QuicklinkDestination.detect` on the **expanded** text, so an unencoded substituted value
that begins with a scheme picks the destination kind — a `{clipboard | raw}` holding `file:///…`
resolves to a local path rather than to the web link the template looked like. Encoding is what
normally prevents that, which is why `| raw` is a deliberate authoring choice and not a default.

`{selectedText}` is accepted as an alias for `{selection}`, so a link pasted from Raycast's docs
works unchanged. `{selection}` stays the canonical spelling and is the only one the editor's
**Insert…** menu writes.

## The argument prompt

A quicklink whose placeholders still need values doesn't open — it collects them first, in the
palette, as `PaletteMode.quicklinkArguments`.

Arguments are collected **one at a time** because the palette has exactly one text field, and that
field _is_ the current argument's input. The screen above it lists every argument with its answer so
far. ↵ commits and advances; on the last one it opens. Backspace on an empty field steps back to the
previous argument and restores what was typed there, so a typo in the second of three fields costs
one keypress rather than the whole flow. An argument declaring `options=` renders its choices as
ordinary selectable rows, so the flat selection index behaves exactly as it does in every other list.

`QuicklinkArgumentSession` captures the expansion context **once**, before the first prompt — the
same rule snippet expansion follows — so `{clipboard}`, `{selection}` and `{date}` cannot drift while
the form is open. Reached from a global shortcut with the palette closed too: `AppCore` records the
frontmost app first, the way `runSystemAction` does, so the selection is read from the window the
user was actually in.

When a template reads the selection and the app in front exposes nothing readable, **Settings →
Quicklinks** decides what happens: substitute the clipboard, or ask for it through the same prompt as
any other argument (a synthetic "Selected Text" argument).

## Opening

`QuicklinkLauncher` owns every platform effect. A path destination is checked with `fileExists`
first, so a deleted folder names itself instead of failing as a silent no-op. `Open With` resolves a
stored bundle ID through Launch Services; an app that has since been uninstalled reports a failure
with an **Open with Default** recovery button rather than silently falling back.

"Open in a new window" passes `--new-window` to the handler. Chromium and Firefox accept it, Safari
ignores it, and an app that doesn't understand an argument drops it — so the setting is honest about
applying only to handlers that accept one. Off is plain `NSWorkspace.open`, which reuses the
frontmost tab; that is what "prefer existing tabs" means, so it is the same switch rather than a
second one.

Every failure — unresolvable link, missing file, missing app, refused open — reports through
Tinycast's own dialog and leaves no partial state.

## Search and pinning

Quicklinks are their own `AppEntry.Kind`, their own `AppIndex` slice and their own launcher section,
between System Settings and Snippets. Only the **name** is indexed; the destination is not searchable
(a URL is a subsequence of almost any query). Per-quicklink "Show in root search" filters the slice;
the pane's "Show in launcher" hides the whole section.

`Quicklink.precedes` is the one display order — pinned first in the order they were pinned, then the
rest by name — and both the store and the launcher slice sort through it, so the two can never
disagree. **Pinned means the top of the Quicklinks section**, not above Applications: a second
position in root search would need a second `AppEntry.Kind`, which the kind invariant forbids for one
feature. The Search Quicklinks screen gives pins their own section, like the clipboard's.

## Search Quicklinks

`PaletteMode.quicklinks` is a sub-screen reached from the `Search Quicklinks` command. Like
Calculator History it stays out of the Tab cycle and exits via the back chevron or a bare backspace.
Its ⌘K menu carries Open (`↵`), Open With Default App (`⌘↵`, only when a handler is saved), Edit,
Duplicate, Pin/Unpin (`⌘.`), Hide/Show in Root Search, Show in Finder (`⌘F`, only for a resolved
path), and Delete (`⌘⌫`).

Choosing an _arbitrary_ app belongs to the editor, which has a picker; `PopoverMenu` is a flat list
with no nesting, so the palette offers the one alternative that always exists — bypass the saved app
and use the system handler, once, without changing what is saved.

## Storage

```text
~/Library/Application Support/<bundle-id>/quicklinks.sqlite3
```

Application Support, not Caches: quicklinks are **authored data, not a regenerable cache**. That one
fact decides the two ways `QuicklinkStore` differs from `ClipboardStore`, which it otherwise mirrors
(WAL, `PRAGMA table_info` column sniffing plus `ALTER TABLE` for migrations, prepared statements, an
`isolated deinit`):

- The database lives beside the snippets library rather than in the cache.
- **A database that won't open is never deleted.** `ClipboardStore` discards and recreates a corrupt
  file because history is regenerable; doing that here would destroy the user's library. The store
  publishes `isAvailable == false`, every mutation refuses with `QuicklinkError.storageUnavailable`,
  and the pane says so. `Tests/quicklink-test.swift` asserts the file survives byte-for-byte.

Editing preserves the UUID, and with it the quicklink's shortcut, favorite slot, visibility and
learned ranking. Deleting goes through `AppCore`, which unwinds all four before removing the row.
Duplicating takes a **new** identity, so the copy can't inherit the original's shortcut.

## Hotkeys

`HotKeyAction.quicklink(id:)` persists under `hotkey.quicklink.<uuid>` with a
`boundQuicklinkIDs` index, the same shape custom commands use — both are per-item rather than
per-catalog-entry, so both need an index for `start()` to re-register from. The store therefore loads
**even while the feature is off** and before `hotKeys.start`: the stale-binding prune reads that
list, and an unloaded store would look like "every quicklink was deleted" and throw the shortcuts
away.

## Import & export

`QuicklinkArchive` is a versioned JSON document (`{"version": 1, "quicklinks": [...]}`), pretty-printed
with ISO 8601 dates so it can be hand-edited; a bare array decodes too, and only `name` and `link` are
required. Duplicate detection is by **name or destination** — either match means the user already has
it — compared against the existing library _and_ against the rest of the incoming file, so one file
can't import its own duplicates. Skipped entries are counted and reported in the summary. An import
takes a fresh identity for every entry, so it can never collide with a shortcut an existing quicklink
owns.

**Replace** is the same read with a different destination: the file becomes the whole library instead
of adding to it. It merges into *nothing*, which is what keeps the two paths honest — a replacement
still drops the file's own duplicates, still refuses a record missing a name or a link, and still takes
fresh identities, so nothing imported can inherit a deleted item's shortcut. The confirmation names
both counts and is asked **after** the file decodes and **before** anything is deleted, so an
unreadable file can never cost you a library. Removal unwinds every reference the way a single delete
does — shortcut, favorite slot, learned ranking — rather than leaving them pointing at ids that are
gone. With an empty library there is nothing to lose, so it imports without asking.

Quicklinks and their bindings also ride in native settings backups, and the settings flags with them.
Unlike `snippetsEnabled`, `quicklinksEnabled` grants no permission class and enables no listening, so
excluding it would be cargo-culting.

# Development

The local loop: set up, build, run, regenerate. Shipping a build is [release.md](release.md);
verifying a change is [testing.md](testing.md).

## Requirements

- macOS 26 or later (Liquid Glass).
- Xcode 26 — it provides the SwiftUI macro plugin and the SDK.
- [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen), and for linting:
  `brew install swiftlint`.

## First-time setup

Create the `Tinycast Self-Signed` code-signing identity once — builds sign with it, which is what keeps
macOS from forgetting the Accessibility grant on every rebuild. Follow **[signing.md](signing.md) §1**,
a few `openssl`/`security` commands.

That is the whole required setup. Editor configuration is personal and the repo does not prescribe it;
the section below is a note for anyone who wants it, not a step.

## Build & run

```sh
open Tinycast.xcodeproj    # then ⌘R
```

Or from the command line:

```sh
xcodebuild -project Tinycast.xcodeproj -scheme Tinycast -configuration Debug build
```

`xcodebuild` uses whatever `xcode-select` points at; if that's the Command Line Tools rather than
Xcode, prefix with `DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer` (the SwiftUI
`@State`/`@FocusState` macros need Xcode's macOS platform).

`Tinycast.xcodeproj` is committed and generated from `project.yml` via XcodeGen — after changing
project settings in `project.yml`, run `xcodegen generate` and commit the result. There is no
`Package.swift`, and `Bundle.module` must never be used ([decisions.md](decisions.md) entry 25).

### The dev channel

Debug builds are a separate channel: **`Tinycast Dev.app`**, bundle id `com.belesky.tinycast.dev`. Every
persisted thing is keyed by bundle id — `~/Library/Preferences/<id>.plist` (settings and hotkey
bindings), `~/Library/Caches/<id>/` (clipboard history, calculator history, exchange rates, frequent
emoji), `~/Library/Application Support/<id>/` (the onboarding marker and snippets), the iCloud
key-value store (its entitlement identifier embeds the bundle id), the `SMAppService` login item, and
the Accessibility / Input Monitoring (TCC) grants — so a local build can neither read nor clobber an
installed app's state, and both run side by side.

Consequences worth knowing:

- The dev build asks for Accessibility on its own the first time, and starts with **no** hotkeys bound
  and onboarding unseen. Grant and bind once; it persists across rebuilds, because the fixed build path
  and the stable signing identity keep the TCC grant alive.
- Don't bind the same global hotkey in both — whichever registered first wins.
- The Hyper Key's Caps Lock remap is `hidutil` state, which is **system-wide, not per-bundle**: quitting
  one build clears the remap for the other, which then needs a rebind or a relaunch to restore it.

## Editor

Xcode works out of the box and needs nothing here. Everything below is optional, and which editor you
use is your business — the repo prescribes none of it.

VS Code gets code intelligence from SourceKit-LSP, which needs a `buildServer.json` because there is no
`Package.swift`. Build once, then hand the log to the sync script — that writes both `buildServer.json`
and the flag database:

```sh
brew install xcode-build-server
xcodebuild -project Tinycast.xcodeproj -scheme Tinycast -configuration Debug \
    -derivedDataPath build/DerivedData build 2>&1 | tee /tmp/tinycast-build.log
./Scripts/sync-lsp.sh /tmp/tinycast-build.log
```

Both files are git-ignored because they embed absolute paths, and `sourcekit-lsp` looks for
`buildServer.json` at the workspace root by name, so it cannot live in a subfolder. After this the
**Build Tinycast.app (debug)** task (⌘⇧B) and **F5** re-run the script on every build, so new and
renamed files keep resolving.

**Do not run `xcode-build-server config`.** It writes `kind: xcode`, and in that mode the server ignores
`.compile` entirely — it serves flags from a cache it scrapes out of `.xcactivitylog` instead. That
cache is only refreshed when `LogStoreManifest.plist` advances, and when the manifest stops updating
(it does) the editor silently pins itself to the source list from some older build: every reference to a
file added since reads *cannot find type X in scope*, in every file, until you restart the server. It
also mixes Release entries in with Debug and lets them win. `Scripts/sync-lsp.sh` keeps the mode
`manual`, where `.compile` is the single source of truth.

### Symbols in `Tests/`

`xcodebuild` never compiles the harnesses — they are not in the Xcode project — so nothing emits a
compile command for them, and without one an open harness reports every shipped type it uses as *cannot
find in scope*. Measured on `fuzz-test.swift`: 60 errors with no entry, 0 with one.

```sh
./Scripts/run-tests.sh --index    # merge the harness compile commands into .compile
```

It reads the source lists from `run-tests.sh` itself, so they cannot drift from what the suite actually
compiles. `Scripts/sync-lsp.sh` runs it too. Three things it has to get right, all of which fail
silently otherwise: every path is absolute, because `sourcekit-lsp` resolves the command itself and does
not apply `directory` to relative arguments; the command carries an explicit `-sdk`; and each entry
claims **only its own harness** in `files`. The command still lists every shipped source it compiles, so
symbols resolve inside the harness — but claiming those sources too would hand them this three-file
command instead of the app's, and `.compile` is last-wins.

Re-run it after adding a harness, then **Swift: Restart LSP Server** from the Command Palette — an
already-running server does not re-read `.compile`.

## Linting

```sh
./Scripts/lint.sh          # lint the whole project
./Scripts/lint.sh --fix    # auto-correct the mechanical subset first
```

[SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) is the only code-quality tool here. `.swiftlint.yml` at
the repo root excludes the generated files and the two off-limits files in `DesignSystem/Scrolling/`.
The comment policy in [standards.md](standards.md#comments) is deliberately not among its rules.

## Formatting

```sh
./Scripts/format.sh            # format Tinycast/ and Tests/ in place
./Scripts/format.sh --check    # report what would change, write nothing (exit 1 if any)
```

`swift-format` from the Xcode toolchain — the same binary sourcekit-lsp formats with, so ⌘S in VS Code
and this script cannot disagree. `.swift-format` at the repo root tunes it to this tree; without it the
stock config defaults to 2-space indent and rewrites all 200 files.

Both `*.generated.swift` files are excluded: formatting one is hand-editing it, and the next
`node Scripts/gen-emoji.js` would revert it. swift-format also refuses any file that does not parse, so
a failure from either command is a syntax error rather than a tooling problem — and it is why ⌘S looks
like it does nothing while a file is mid-edit with unbalanced braces.

**Read [decisions.md](decisions.md) entry 26 before leaning on this.** A formatter was rejected here on
measured evidence, and the entry stands: running it over the tree touched 68 files, and 67 of those
changed more than whitespace.

The config sticks to rules that catch defects and stays quiet about style, because **there is no
formatter** — see [decisions.md](decisions.md) entry 26 for the measurements behind that. Formatting is
Xcode's re-indent (⌃I), as it always has been. Two consequences worth knowing:

- `empty_count` is **disabled**, and `isEmpty`-style rewrites are unsafe here generally:
  `LauncherRankingRecord` and `PaletteRowIndex` have a `count` that is a hit count, not a collection
  count. A rule that rewrites `count > 0` to `!isEmpty` on them does not compile.
- `force_try` is an error; `force_cast` only warns, because the AX and AppKit bridges have four
  legitimate ones.

Errors block, warnings do not. CI runs this same script on every PR and annotates the diff with each
violation — see [release.md](release.md#continuous-integration) — so run it locally first rather than
finding out from a review.

## Generated data

Two Swift files are emitted by scripts and must never be hand-edited. Both download their source, so
run them online, then commit the result:

```sh
node Scripts/gen-emoji.js            # -> Tinycast/Features/Emoji/Model/EmojiData.generated.swift
node Scripts/gen-currencies.js       # -> Tinycast/Features/Calculator/Model/CurrencyData.generated.swift
```

`gen-currencies.js` joins two sources on the ISO code: **Frankfurter**'s currency list — the same feed
`CurrencyRateStore` fetches rates from, so the table and the rate source cannot drift apart — and
**Unicode CLDR**'s `en` currency data, which supplies display names, signs and the singular/plural
noun. It reads the pinned `cldr-json` checkout rather than the host's `Intl`, whose output shifts with
the local ICU version and would make the file unreproducible.

Only unambiguous data is emitted. Anything two currencies claim — `dollars`, `pounds`, `krona` — is
left out and decided by hand in `CalcCurrency.contested`, the one currency table still written by hand.
Re-run the script when a currency is added or retired; nothing breaks in the meantime, since an
unquoted code just reports "no exchange rate".

## Spawning a tool

Anything that shells out sets `process.environment = SubprocessEnvironment.inherited` rather than
letting the child inherit the app's environment as-is.

Xcode injects debugging dylibs into a Debug run — `libMainThreadChecker`, `libBacktraceRecording`,
the view-debugger support library — through `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`, and every subprocess inherits
them. That is enough to break any tool which reads its own executable to find an appended payload:
a Deno-compiled binary exits 1 with `error: Did not find magic bytes`. Go and Rust tools are
unaffected, which is why `herdr` worked and `linear` did not.

The symptom is worth recognising, because it inverts the usual order of trust: the feature works from
a terminal, works from a signed `.app` launched with `open`, works from a Release build — and fails
**only** when the app is launched from Xcode, which is the one way it is usually run while being
written. `SubprocessEnvironment.stripping` drops `DYLD_*` and `__XPC_DYLD_*` and keeps everything
else; `linear-test` pins exactly that.

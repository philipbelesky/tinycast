Tinycast needs **macOS 26 or later**. There is a separate cask for macOS 15 Sequoia — see
[Older macOS](#older-macos).

## Homebrew

This is the recommended route, because Homebrew clears the macOS quarantine flag for you on every
install and update.

```bash
brew trust --tap abue-ammar/tinycast
brew install --cask abue-ammar/tinycast/tinycast
```

`brew trust` is required once for any third-party tap; Homebrew refuses to install from an untrusted
tap without it.

### Channels

Each channel is a **separate application** with its own bundle identifier, settings, permissions and
login item. They run side by side, so you can keep stable installed while trying a beta.

| Channel | Cask            | App                 |
| ------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| Stable  | `tinycast`      | `Tinycast.app`      |
| Beta    | `tinycast@beta` | `Tinycast Beta.app` |

```bash
brew install --cask abue-ammar/tinycast/tinycast@beta
```

Because the channels are separate apps, installing the beta does not upgrade your stable install and
does not share its settings. To move settings across, use
[Backup](/docs/reference/backup).

### Older macOS

Tinycast also runs on macOS 15 Sequoia through its own cask:

```bash
brew install --cask abue-ammar/tinycast/tinycast-sequoia
```

macOS 26 is the primary target and gets features first.

## Downloading the DMG

Builds are also published on the
[Releases page](https://github.com/abue-ammar/tinycast/releases).

Tinycast is **self-signed** — there is no paid Developer ID certificate behind it — so macOS
quarantines a hand-downloaded copy and refuses to open it. Clear the flag once, after dragging the
app to Applications:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Tinycast.app"
```

You do **not** need this if you installed through Homebrew.

## Updating

```bash
brew upgrade --cask abue-ammar/tinycast/tinycast
```

Every release is signed with the same certificate, which is what keeps your Accessibility grant
alive across updates instead of asking for it again.

## Uninstalling

```bash
brew uninstall --cask abue-ammar/tinycast/tinycast
```

To remove the files Tinycast created, delete its Application Support and Caches folders:

```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.tinycast.app
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.tinycast.app
```

Your snippets, notes and quicklinks live in that Application Support folder, so copy anything you
want to keep out first.

To remove a _different_ app and everything it left behind, Tinycast has a
[built-in uninstaller](/docs/launcher/uninstall).

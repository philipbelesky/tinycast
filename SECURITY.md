# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report privately through GitHub: **Security** tab → **Report a vulnerability**.

Include your macOS version, the Tinycast version and channel, reproduction steps, and the impact.
Please don't disclose publicly until it's fixed.

We'll respond as quickly as we can and keep you posted.

## Supported Versions

Current stable and beta only. Update (`brew upgrade --cask tinycast`) before reporting.

## Scope

Of particular interest:

- **Accessibility (TCC)** — anything that widens what the paste grant enables.
- **Clipboard history** — text and images cached on disk; unintended exposure or capture.
- **Network** — every networked feature has a switch, and this fork ships them all on (FORK.md
  divergence 15). A path that reaches the network with its switch off, or survives one being turned
  off mid-request, is high severity.
- **Hotkeys** — the in-house hotkey stack and the Input Monitoring grant.
- **Signing and distribution** — the DMG and Homebrew cask chain.

Out of scope: builds being self-signed rather than notarized (known, see
[`docs/signing.md`](docs/signing.md)), and anything needing existing code execution or admin rights on
the machine.
